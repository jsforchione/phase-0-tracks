<!-- 1. Semantic tags are used to give meaning to the elements used to 		both the browser and the developer. I think the nav tag and 		section tag are really useful. The nav tag is especially useful 	for people who are using a screen reader. It signals to them that 	  what follows is a set of navigation links. 
	2. A browser display elements on a page in the order they are written, typically it goes header, nav, section-heading-article, aside, footer. Some of these elements can be mixed and matched so it really depends on how you want your web page to look.
	3. I learned that you can create snippets that provide pre-written code for your convenience! This definitely can save you a lot of time not having to write out the basic skeleton of a document everytime. I definitely think I'll create more snippets later on - for CSS, Ruby, etc.
	4. Tables have been difficult for me to grasp. I think mainly because in my mind rowspan and colspan do the opposite of what I think they should do. A column goes up and down, so you would think that using colspan would take up however many cells vertically, however it's horizontally. And rowspan goes vertically instead of horizontally. I really don't know why this is.  -->
