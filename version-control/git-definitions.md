# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control keeps track of changes made to a repo through save points. It's extremely useful because it lets you go back to different version of code, which can be used for debugging, etc.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of your entire repo. A master branch is the clean version of your repo. You make feature branches (which are initialized with a copy of the master branch) to work on different features. You only merge feature branches with the master once you are sure the changes you made are correct. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point. A good commit message is one that is specific, yet concise.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when there is code that does not match on the branches you are merging. To fix this you go into the branches and delete the code that you do not want, or write new code.
