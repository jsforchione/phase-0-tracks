        I love nourishing my body with food that I know is improving my health and overall wellbeing. I feel good when I eat good, and wanted to share my knowledge on my favorite superfoods (while simulateously practicing jquery ;) ).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Acai - high in antioxidants!</li>
        <li>Cacao - contains flavanoids which helps lower blood pressure!</li>
        <li>Chia Seeds - packed with omega-3s, fiber, and calcium!</li>
        <li>Hemp Seeds - high in protein and contain all the essential amino acids needed for growth and repair!</li>
        <li>Spirulina - an algae that is high in protein and an excellent source of vitamins!</li>
        <li>Spinach or Kale - lots and lots of vitamins and minerals!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The best part about superfoods is that they're super easy to incorporate into your diet. I eat pretty much all of what's on the list above daily. I put spinach, kale, or spirulina into smoothies (I don't love salads) and you can't even taste the difference. I put cacao in my smoothies, and they instantly tast like chocolate milkshakes, but it's good for you! I top my oatmeal with chia and hemp seeds as an added boost of protein and healthy fats. And I make acai bowls and top with lots of fruit and granola.
